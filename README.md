# COVID 19 Simulation
## report coming back soon

Clicking the above will show a deployed version of the report in a new tab!

Initially created for a year 12 methods investigation

> This investigation will explore, through the use of simulations, the effectiveness of various preventative measures aimed at controlling the rate at which COVID-19 spreads through communities. For each  > trial the simulations will be altered to attempt to replicate preventative conditions introduced by the Australian government, and then discuss how this affects the exponential growth of the number of   > infected people. This will hopefully demonstrate why these measures are implemented and why they should be followed.
